    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a
      snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured
      alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the
      classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tortilla: Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.</li>

        pepper, and dried oregano.

        Toppings: Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell
        pepper, and green onions. Of course, you can customize the toppings to
        suit your taste.
